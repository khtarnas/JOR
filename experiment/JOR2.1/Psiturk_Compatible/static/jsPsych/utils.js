It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop. Please answer the question below honestly, but for the next question, pick 'never.' Psychologists most generally classify memory as Declarative or Implicit, where Declarative memories include memories for people, places, and events in our lives. It is this type of memory that is most often intended when speaking about memory.<p>" +
