                        You have been invited to take part in a research study being
                        conducted by the Computational Memory Lab at the University
                        of Pennsylvania. In this study, you will see cards containing
                        words and later be asked to judge how recently you saw them.
                        Full instructions will be provided before
                        the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experiment will last approximately 45-60 minutes, not
                        counting breaks. The only minor risk of the study is fatigue
                        from completing the task. There will be opportunities to
                        rest between trials, in case you need to take a break at any
                        point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may stop
                        the experiment at any time. If you have any questions about
                        your rights as a research participant, or about this study
                        in general, please contact the principal investigator:
